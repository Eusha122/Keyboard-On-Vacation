# Keyboard Blocker (Python)

This script uses the `keyboard` library to intercept and suppress all keyboard input, effectively disabling the keyboard while the program is running.

## ⚠️ Warning
Running this script will block **all key presses**, which may prevent you from typing in the terminal to stop it. Use with caution.

You may need to force-close the terminal or kill the process if you get locked out.
